# UK-Road-Safety-Analysis
This project analysed the UK Road Safety Dataset to develop predictive models for determining accident severity. The models help insurance companies offer tailored premiums based on driver risk profiles. The dataset included over 1 million accident records, with key features such as vehicle type, driver age, and road/weather conditions.
